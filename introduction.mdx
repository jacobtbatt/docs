## First off...What is Thnks?

If you're interested in learning more about Thnks...

* The application is efficient and scalable and ensures full financial and compliance control for administrators. 
* Recipients can accept their Thnks seamlessly with no app install or account creation needed. 
* Create your account on [Web](http://app.thnks.com/), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thnks-smarter-business-gifting/id1186906257?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thnks) to start giving now.

## Our History & Mission

* Our founding team is comprised of sales and account professionals who wanted a better way to say “thank you” to clients.
* The struggle is real...people are just too busy and expectations are higher than ever before.
* The "just following up" email or branded t-shirts and cupcakes are generic, and most importantly, all about the sender when they should be about the recipient.
* It is more important than ever before to find differentiated channels to reach out and connect in a business context.
* Our mission is to build stronger, longer lasting business relationships through unique and thoughtful everyday giving. 

**We are personalizing, modernizing, and simplifying corporate giving— create an account on [Web](http://app.thnks.com/), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thnks-smarter-business-gifting/id1186906257?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thnks) to get involved!**

## Who is Thnks for?

* **Everyone:** Anyone can use Thnks! Whether you are a business owner, freelancer, salesperson, marketer, or simply a human that wants to show your gratitude, Thnks will help you form stronger connections.

* **Professionals:** Thnks provides sales and marketing professionals with a better way of reaching out and staying top of mind with clients or prospects- instead of sending yet another branded coffee mug or fruit basket, send something personal to show your gratitude. Thnks will shorten your sales cycle and give you an edge over the competition...all by building stronger business relationships. 

* **Team managers:** Thnks provides team managers (sales, finance, compliance and more) with more control over, and real-time reporting into their team's activity.

## What can I send through Thnks?

We offer a range of different gestures within Thnks- everything from a small but thoughtful cup of coffee to experiential Thnks items like Uber rides and movie tickets, to more premium options like small batch liquor, wine bundles and curated boxes. 
​
Your Thnks items will be sent instantly to your recipient via email or SMS. 

>* With Thnks like Starbucks Coffee, Panera Bread Lunch, and Krispy Kreme Donuts, your recipient will be presented with a barcode on hitting accept, which they can scan in-store at any time/location of their choice. 
>* With physical Thnks like snack boxes or premium wine bundles, your recipient will be prompted to enter their address and their Thnks item will be sent straight to them within 5-7 business days.
