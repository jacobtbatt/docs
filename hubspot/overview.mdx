## How It Works

### Automatic Synchronization

Once connected, the integration automatically synchronizes your Thnks activity with HubSpot:

1. **Initial Backfill**: All historical Thnks transactions are imported into HubSpot as custom object records
2. **Hourly Sync**: New transactions are synchronized every hour automatically
3. **Status Updates**: Thnks status changes are tracked and updated in real-time
4. **Auto-Association**: Thnks records are automatically linked to matching Contacts and Deals based on email addresses
