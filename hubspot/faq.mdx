## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What Thnks plan do I need?">
    The HubSpot integration is available for organizations on the **Enterprise or Enterprise+** plan level. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [sales@thnks.com](mailto:sales@thnks.com) for information on upgrading.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the integration available in the HubSpot App Marketplace?">
    The Thnks HubSpot Integration is currently in **preview** and not yet available in the HubSpot App Marketplace. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) to request access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this integration alongside the webhook/custom code integration?">
    Yes, you can use both. The native HubSpot integration provides automatic synchronization and a richer experience, while the [custom code integration](/thnks_integrations/hubspot) gives you more flexibility for workflow automation. They can complement each other depending on your use case.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setup & Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started with the integration?">
    1. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or email [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com)
    2. Confirm your Thnks organization has the integration enabled
    3. Receive your personalized setup link
    4. Authorize the connection using HubSpot Super Admin credentials
    5. Wait for the initial data backfill to complete

    See the full [Installation Guide](/hubspot/install) for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What permissions does the integration need?">
    The integration requires the following HubSpot permissions:

    - **CRM Contacts**: Read and write access to match recipients
    - **Custom Objects**: Create and manage Thnks records
    - **Schema Access**: Read custom object schemas

    These permissions are requested during the OAuth authorization flow and can be revoked at any time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who can authorize the integration?">
    A **HubSpot Super Admin** must authorize the initial connection. This is required because the integration creates custom objects and needs elevated permissions.

    After setup, all users with access to the Thnks custom object can view synchronized data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does the initial sync take?">
    The initial backfill typically completes within **a few minutes**. Timing depends on your transaction history volume. Organizations with thousands of historical transactions may take longer.

    You'll receive confirmation when the backfill is complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Synchronization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often does data sync?">
    The integration synchronizes data **every hour**. This includes:

    - New Thnks transactions
    - Status updates on existing transactions (Delivered, Opened, Redeemed, etc.)
    - New associations with Contacts and Deals

    If you need immediate sync, contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data is synchronized?">
    Each Thnks transaction syncs with the following data:

    - Thnks name, type, and amount
    - Sender name and email
    - Recipient name and email
    - Personal message
    - Current status and status timestamps
    - Tracking URL
    - Transaction ID

    See [Features](/hubspot/features) for the complete list of fields.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the integration sync historical transactions?">
    Yes. When you first connect the integration, it performs a **complete historical backfill** of all past Thnks transactions. This means your entire Thnks history will be available in HubSpot.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trigger a manual sync?">
    Manual sync triggers are available by request. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) if you need to sync immediately after a large batch of Thnks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the sync fails?">
    The integration includes automatic retry logic. If a sync fails due to a temporary issue (network, rate limits, etc.), it will retry automatically.

    If syncs repeatedly fail, the Thnks team will be notified and will investigate. Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) if you notice missing data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Associations & Matching

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are Thnks matched to Contacts?">
    The integration matches Thnks to Contacts based on **recipient email address**. When a Thnks is synced:

    1. The integration searches for a Contact with the recipient's email
    2. If found, the Thnks record is associated with that Contact
    3. If not found, the Thnks record is created without a Contact association

    Orphaned records (without Contact matches) can be re-associated later when Contacts are added.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if multiple Contacts have the same email?">
    If duplicate Contacts exist with the same email, the integration associates the Thnks with the **most recently active** Contact. We recommend merging duplicate Contacts in HubSpot for best results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Deal association work?">
    Thnks records are associated with Deals when:

    1. The recipient matches a Contact in HubSpot
    2. That Contact is linked to a Deal via Contact Role
    3. The Deal is currently open (not Closed Won or Closed Lost)

    This enables you to track which deals have received Thnks engagement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually associate Thnks records?">
    Yes. You can manually associate Thnks records with Contacts, Companies, and Deals directly in HubSpot using the standard association interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is re-association and when should I use it?">
    Re-association scans all Thnks records and attempts to link them with Contacts based on current data. Use it when:

    - You've added new Contacts that should match existing Thnks
    - You've updated Contact email addresses
    - You've merged duplicate Contacts

    Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) to trigger a re-association job.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see any Thnks data in HubSpot">
    Check the following:

    1. **Wait for sync**: Initial backfill may take a few minutes
    2. **Verify connection**: Confirm the OAuth connection is active
    3. **Check your Thnks account**: Ensure there are transactions to sync
    4. **Correct portal**: Verify you connected the correct HubSpot portal

    If issues persist, contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thnks aren't associated with the right Contacts">
    This usually indicates an email mismatch. Verify that:

    1. The recipient email in Thnks matches the Contact email in HubSpot
    2. There aren't duplicate Contacts with the same email
    3. The Contact existed when the Thnks was synced (or request re-association)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The OAuth connection failed">
    Try these steps:

    1. Ensure you're logged in as a HubSpot Super Admin
    2. Verify your HubSpot plan supports custom objects (Professional or Enterprise)
    3. Clear your browser cache and cookies
    4. Try a different browser or incognito mode
    5. Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) for assistance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token expired or authentication errors">
    The integration automatically refreshes OAuth tokens. If you see authentication errors:

    1. The refresh may be in progress—wait a few minutes
    2. If errors persist, you may need to re-authorize the connection
    3. Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) for help

    Re-authorizing will not cause data loss; existing Thnks records remain in HubSpot.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I disconnect the integration?">
    To disconnect:

    1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connected Apps** in HubSpot
    2. Find the Thnks integration
    3. Click **"Uninstall"** or **"Disconnect"**

    Existing Thnks records will remain in HubSpot unless manually deleted. Sync will stop for new transactions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. The integration uses industry-standard security:

    - **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication without password sharing
    - **HTTPS**: All data transmitted over encrypted connections
    - **Per-organization isolation**: Each organization's data is isolated
    - **Token rotation**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my data if I disconnect?">
    When you disconnect the integration:

    - **Sync stops**: No new Thnks will be synced to HubSpot
    - **Data remains**: Existing Thnks custom object records stay in HubSpot
    - **Manual deletion**: You can delete records manually if needed

    Reconnecting will resume sync and backfill any missed transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete Thnks records from HubSpot?">
    Yes. You can delete individual Thnks records or bulk delete from the custom object list view in HubSpot. Deleting records in HubSpot does not affect your Thnks account data.
  </Accordion>
