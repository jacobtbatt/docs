<Note>
  **Preview Release**: The Thnks HubSpot Integration is currently in preview. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) to request access.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before beginning installation, ensure you have:

- **Thnks Account**: Enterprise or Enterprise+ plan level
- **HubSpot Account**: Professional or Enterprise tier (custom objects require paid plans)
- **HubSpot Permissions**: Super Admin access to authorize the integration
- **Integration Enabled**: Contact Thnks to enable HubSpot integration for your organization

## Installation Process

### Step 1: Request Access

Contact your Thnks Account Manager or email [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) to:

1. Enable the HubSpot integration for your Thnks organization
2. Receive your unique setup link
3. Confirm your HubSpot portal ID

### Step 2: Authorize the Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Setup Link">
    Click the personalized setup link provided by your Thnks Account Manager. This link is unique to your organization and includes your enterprise credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign In to HubSpot">
    You'll be redirected to HubSpot's authorization page. Sign in with your HubSpot Super Admin account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Permissions">
    Review the permissions requested by the Thnks integration:

    - **CRM Objects**: Read and write access to Contacts, Companies, and Deals
    - **Custom Objects**: Create and manage Thnks custom object records
    - **Schema Access**: Read custom object schemas for data mapping

    These permissions are required for the integration to sync Thnks data and associate records with your CRM objects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    Click **"Grant Access"** or **"Connect App"** to authorize the integration. You'll be redirected back to confirm the connection was successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Initial Data Sync

Once authorized, the integration automatically performs an initial backfill:

1. **Historical Import**: All past Thnks transactions are imported into HubSpot
2. **Record Creation**: Thnks custom object records are created for each transaction
3. **Auto-Association**: Records are linked to matching Contacts and Deals based on email addresses
4. **Status Sync**: Current status of each Thnks is imported

<Note>
  **Timing**: The initial backfill typically completes within a few minutes, depending on your transaction history volume. You'll receive a confirmation once complete.
</Note>

### Step 4: Verify Installation

After the initial sync completes, verify the installation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Custom Objects">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Data Management** → **Objects** in HubSpot. You should see a "Thnks" custom object listed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Thnks Records">
    Go to **CRM** → **Thnks** (or search for "Thnks" in the global search). You should see your historical Thnks transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Contact Associations">
    Open a Contact record that has received a Thnks. In the associated records section, you should see linked Thnks records.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Post-Installation Configuration

### User Email Matching

For the integration to correctly attribute Thnks sent by your team members:

- **Matching Requirement**: Thnks user email addresses must match their HubSpot user email addresses
- **Why It Matters**: This enables proper recipient attribution and allows users to view their sent Thnks within HubSpot

<Warning>
  If a Thnks user's email doesn't match any HubSpot user, the Thnks will still sync but may not be attributed to the correct sender within HubSpot.
</Warning>

### Contact Association Settings

The integration automatically associates Thnks records with Contacts based on recipient email addresses. If multiple Contacts share the same email:

- The most recently active Contact is associated
- You can manually reassociate records if needed

### Deal Association

Thnks records can be associated with Deals when:

1. The recipient Contact is associated with a Deal via Contact Role
2. The Deal is currently open (not Closed Won or Closed Lost)

## Ongoing Synchronization

After installation, the integration operates automatically:

| Sync Type | Frequency | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Transaction Sync | Hourly | New Thnks transactions are synced every hour |
| Status Updates | Hourly | Thnks status changes are updated (Delivered, Opened, Redeemed) |
| Token Refresh | Automatic | OAuth tokens are refreshed automatically before expiration |

### Manual Sync Trigger

If you need to trigger an immediate sync (e.g., after sending a large batch of Thnks), contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com).

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Connection Failed

If the OAuth connection fails:

1. Ensure you're logged into HubSpot with Super Admin credentials
2. Verify your HubSpot plan supports custom objects (Professional or Enterprise)
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) if issues persist

### No Data After Connection

If no Thnks records appear after installation:

1. **Wait for backfill**: Initial sync may take a few minutes
2. **Check your Thnks account**: Ensure there are transactions to sync
3. **Verify portal ID**: Confirm you connected the correct HubSpot portal
4. **Contact support**: Reach out to [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com)

### Missing Associations

If Thnks records aren't associated with Contacts:

1. **Email mismatch**: Verify the recipient email exists on a Contact record
2. **Multiple Contacts**: Check if duplicate Contacts exist with the same email
3. **Re-association**: Contact support to trigger a re-association job

## Disconnecting the Integration

To disconnect the Thnks integration from HubSpot:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Connected Apps** in HubSpot
2. Find the Thnks integration
3. Click **"Uninstall"** or **"Disconnect"**

<Warning>
  **Data Retention**: Disconnecting the integration will stop future syncs. Existing Thnks custom object records will remain in HubSpot unless manually deleted.
</Warning>
