</Note>

## Automatic Transaction Synchronization

The core feature of the Thnks HubSpot Integration is automatic, bidirectional synchronization of your Thnks activity with HubSpot CRM.

### How Sync Works

The integration synchronizes Thnks transactions to HubSpot automatically:

| Sync Event | Timing | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Initial Backfill | On first connection | All historical transactions are imported |
| Scheduled Sync | Every hour | New transactions and status updates are synced |
| Status Updates | With each sync | Thnks status changes are propagated to HubSpot |

### What Gets Synchronized

Every Thnks transaction creates a custom object record in HubSpot with the following data:

**Thnks Information**
- Thnks name and type
- Thnks amount (dollar value)
- Personal message included with the Thnks
- Tracking URL for the transaction

**Sender Details**
- Sender name
- Sender email address
- Sending timestamp

**Recipient Details**
- Recipient name
- Recipient email address
- Recipient phone (if applicable)

**Status Tracking**
- Current status (see Status Lifecycle below)
- Timestamp for each status change
- Delivery and redemption dates

### Status Lifecycle

Thnks progress through a defined status lifecycle. The integration tracks each status change:

```
Sent → Delivered → Opened → Redeemed
                         ↘ Refunded
                         ↘ Expired
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sent** | Thnks has been sent to the recipient |
| **Scheduled** | Thnks is scheduled for future delivery |
| **Delivered** | Thnks notification delivered to recipient |
| **Opened** | Recipient has viewed the Thnks |
| **Redeemed** | Recipient has redeemed/used the Thnks |
| **Refunded** | Thnks was refunded (unredeemed or manually expired) |
| **Expired** | Thnks expired before redemption |

Each status change is timestamped, enabling detailed engagement analysis.

## Auto-Association

The integration automatically links Thnks records to relevant HubSpot CRM objects, eliminating manual data entry.

### Contact Association

When a Thnks is synced, the integration:

1. Searches for a Contact with a matching email address
2. Associates the Thnks record with the Contact
3. Links appear in the Contact's associated records section

**Handling Duplicates**: If multiple Contacts share the same email, the integration associates with the most recently active Contact.

### Company Association

Thnks records are associated with Companies through the Contact relationship:

1. Contact is matched by email
2. Contact's primary Company is identified
3. Thnks record is associated with both Contact and Company

### Deal Association

Thnks records can be associated with Deals when specific criteria are met:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Match">
    The recipient must match a Contact in HubSpot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact Role">
    The Contact must be associated with a Deal via Contact Role
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deal Status">
    The Deal must be open (not Closed Won or Closed Lost)
  </Step>
</Steps>

This enables powerful pipeline visibility—see exactly which deals have received Thnks engagement.

### Re-Association

If Contacts are added or updated after Thnks have been synced, you can request a re-association:

- Contact [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:integrations@thnks.com) to trigger a re-association job
- Orphaned Thnks records (those without Contact matches) will be re-evaluated
- New associations are created based on current Contact data

## Thnks Custom Object

The integration creates a custom object in HubSpot to store Thnks transaction data.

### Object Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Thnks Name | Text | Name of the Thnks |
| Thnks Amount | Currency | Dollar value of the Thnks |
| Sender Name | Text | Full name of sender |
| Sender Email | Email | Email address of sender |
| Recipient Name | Text | Full name of recipient |
| Recipient Email | Email | Email address of recipient |
| Status | Dropdown | Current Thnks status |
| Message | Text (Long) | Personal message included |
| Sent Date | DateTime | When the Thnks was sent |
| Delivered Date | DateTime | When delivery was confirmed |
| Opened Date | DateTime | When recipient viewed the Thnks |
| Redeemed Date | DateTime | When recipient redeemed the Thnks |
| Tracking URL | URL | Direct link to transaction |
| Transaction ID | Text | Unique Thnks transaction identifier |

### Viewing Thnks Records

Access Thnks records in HubSpot:

**From Global Search**
- Search for "Thnks" in the HubSpot global search
- View all Thnks records in a list view

**From CRM Navigation**
- Navigate to **CRM** → **Thnks**
- Use filters to find specific records

**From Contact Records**
- Open any Contact record
- View associated Thnks in the associations panel

### Building Reports

Leverage HubSpot's reporting tools with Thnks data:

**Example Report Ideas**
- Total Thnks sent per month
- Redemption rate by Thnks type
- Top senders on your team
- Thnks sent per pipeline stage
- Average Thnks value by deal size

<Note>
  Custom object reporting requires HubSpot Professional or Enterprise plans.
</Note>

## Thnks Sending (Coming Soon)

<Note>
  The Thnks sending feature is currently in development and will be available in a future release.
</Note>

The integration will support sending Thnks directly from HubSpot Contact records:

**Planned Capabilities**
- Send Thnks button on Contact records
- Browse Thnks catalog within HubSpot
- Customize messages
- Schedule future Thnks
- Track sent Thnks in real-time

## Portal Statistics

Track your organization's Thnks activity at a glance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Thnks Sent | Cumulative count of all Thnks sent |
| Total Value | Sum of all Thnks amounts |
| Average Thnks Value | Mean Thnks amount |
| Top Thnks Types | Most frequently sent Thnks |
| Redemption Rate | Percentage of Thnks redeemed |
| Recent Activity | Latest sending and redemption events |

## Security & Compliance

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication

The integration uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication:

- **No password sharing**: Users authorize via HubSpot's secure login
- **Scoped access**: Integration only requests necessary permissions
- **Token refresh**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed
- **Revocable**: Disconnect anytime from HubSpot settings

### Data Handling

- **Encrypted transmission**: All data transferred via HTTPS
- **Per-organization isolation**: Each organization's data is isolated
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of all synced transactions
- **Data retention**: Thnks records persist in HubSpot until deleted

### Permission Requirements

The integration requires these HubSpot scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `crm.objects.contacts.read` | Read Contact records for matching |
| `crm.objects.contacts.write` | Update Contact associations |
| `crm.objects.custom.read` | Read Thnks custom object records |
| `crm.objects.custom.write` | Create and update Thnks records |
| `crm.schemas.custom.read` | Read custom object schema definitions |

## Best Practices

### Maximize Data Quality

1. **Consistent Emails**: Ensure recipient emails in Thnks match Contact emails in HubSpot
2. **Avoid Duplicates**: Merge duplicate Contacts before connecting the integration
3. **Update Contact Roles**: Keep Deal Contact Roles current for accurate Deal associations

### Optimize for Reporting

1. **Create Custom Views**: Build filtered views of Thnks records by status, date, or Thnks type
2. **Schedule Reports**: Set up automated reports on Thnks activity
3. **Use Dashboards**: Add Thnks metrics to your HubSpot dashboards

### Team Coordination

1. **Match User Emails**: Ensure Thnks user emails match HubSpot user emails
2. **Train Your Team**: Share best practices for effective Thnks usage
3. **Review Activity**: Regularly review Thnks activity for team coaching

## Feature Roadmap

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Direct Sending**: Send Thnks from within HubSpot UI
- **Workflow Triggers**: Trigger Thnks based on HubSpot workflow events
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Pre-built Thnks dashboards and reports
- **Real-time Sync**: Immediate synchronization (vs. hourly)
