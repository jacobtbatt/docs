Thnks offers a few different ways for you to set your team members up for sending Thnks. They are:


* Personal Cards: Each user must use their own credit card to make purchases
* Team Card: A single credit card is put on file and all purchases are made using that card
* Balance: Pre-loaded funds paid by ACH or credit card that your team members use to send Thnks

You can choose/change your preferred method at any time by clicking the "Admin" tab at the top right corner of the page and then clicking "Payment" on the left.
