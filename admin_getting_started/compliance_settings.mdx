If your organization has compliance rules that must be adhered to you can apply them to our platform:

* Click the "Admin" tab at the top right corner of the page

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/admin_getting_started_images/admin_header.png"
  alt="Thnks Admin Top Bar"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/admin_getting_started_images/admin_header.png"
  alt="Thnks Admin Top Bar"
/>

* Click "Compliance" on the left
  * <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/admin_getting_started_images/compliance_tab.png"
    alt="Thnks Admin Payment Panel"
    />
    <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/admin_getting_started_images/compliance_tab.png"
    alt="Thnks Admin Payment Panel"
    />

Here you can limit how much your team can spend on a single Thnks, exempt certain users, block the ability to send to specific domains, limit how much a recipient can receive in a selected time frame, and leave a note for your team's visibility of the compliance rules.
