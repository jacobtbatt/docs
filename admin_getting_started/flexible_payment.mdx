* If more than one payment method is made available for the team:
  * The Team Admin will be able to set the default payment method (by default, the method that was enabled first will be selected as the default one)
  * The Team Admin will be able to add an optional note and display title for each enabled payment method
  * Team Users will be able to choose one of the enabled payment methods on the “Confirm your Thnks” page when sending a Thnks (the “default” method will be selected automatically)
  * Team Users will be able to see the title and the note specified for each payment method on the “Confirm your Thnks” page
