## Spend Limit
The Spend Limit is a feature for teams with a Team Level subscription or higher. It allows the team administrator to control monthly spending by setting limits. Here’s how it works:

>* Monthly Reset: Spend Limits reset every month on the 1st at 12:00 AM CST.
>* Lock/Unlock Feature:
>>* Locked: Users can't spend beyond their limit. This helps control budget more strictly.
>>* Unlocked: Users are warned if they’re about to exceed their limit but can decide to continue spending. This offers more flexibility.

## Spend Target
The Spend Target complements the Spend Limit for teams on the Team Level or above. It focuses on individual user spending within a team. Here's what you need to know:

>* Monthly Reset: Like Spend Limits, Spend Targets reset on the 1st of every month at 12:00 AM CST.
>* Linked to Spend Limit: The enforcement of Spend Targets depends on the team's Spend Limit setting. If Spend Limit is Locked: Users cannot exceed their Spend Targets. This ensures tight budget control.
>* If Spend Limit is Unlocked: Users get a notification if they're about to go over their Spend Target but can opt to spend more. This allows individual discretion within the broader budget framework.
>* Purpose: Aims to give administrators the ability to set specific spending goals for each team member, promoting accountability and financial planning.


Team Admins can assign individual monthly spend targets (per team and user) on the Thnks Admin Panel.
