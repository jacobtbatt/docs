## Welcome

Welcome to the new Thnks API Documentation.  As a Thnks Admin, you have access to many different automation features that are now being made public!

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Authorization API tokens and are requested from a Thnks Team Member.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "Authorization": []
  }
]
```
