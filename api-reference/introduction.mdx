## Welcome

Welcome to the new Thnks API Documentation.  As a Thnks Admin, you have access to many different automation features that are now being made public!

## Headers

All API endpoints are authenticated using an Authorization API token and are requested from a Thnks Team Member.

```json
"headers": [
  {
    "Authorization": "<api_key>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
]
```
