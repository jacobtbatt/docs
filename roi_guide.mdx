```

### Meeting Show Rate Impact
```
Show Rate Improvement = (Show Rate with Thnks - Show Rate without Thnks) / Show Rate without Thnks × 100
```

### Deal Velocity Improvement
```
Velocity Improvement = (Average days without Thnks - Average days with Thnks) / Average days without Thnks × 100
```

### Customer Lifetime Value Impact
```
CLV Impact = (Average CLV with Thnks - Average CLV without Thnks) / Average CLV without Thnks × 100
```
