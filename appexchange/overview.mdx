## Integration Overview

Thnks has partnered with Salesforce to provide our clients with an application built specifically for Salesforce and available on the AppExchange. Version 1.8 introduces **bidirectional functionality**, allowing you to both:

- **Send Thnks from Salesforce** ‚Üí Initiate Thnks directly from Salesforce records
- **Receive Thnks data in Salesforce** ‚Üí Capture all Thnks activity from web, mobile, and extension usage

## What Does It Do?

The Thnks Salesforce AppExchange application provides comprehensive Thnks management within your Salesforce environment through two main approaches:

### 1. Send Thnks from Salesforce

- **Direct Sending**: Click "Send a Thnks" button on Contact, Account, or Opportunity pages
- **Automated Workflows**: Configure Salesforce Flows to automatically trigger Thnks based on business events
- **Approval Processes**: Set up approval workflows for Thnks requests before they're sent

### 2. Track Thnks Activity

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: All Thnks activity is captured and associated with relevant Salesforce records
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes are automatically tracked with timestamps
- **ROI Insights**: Custom field mapping provides detailed ROI analytics

### Data Model

The application uses two primary objects:

- **Thnks Object**: Tracks all sent Thnks with status updates and associations
- **Thnks Request Object**: Manages workflow-triggered Thnks with approval processes

Both objects automatically associate with Lead, Contact, Account, and Opportunity records using intelligent matching logic. Task creation provides visibility in Salesforce's standard activity feed.

## How Does It Work?

### Sending Thnks from Salesforce

**Direct Sending Process:**

1. User clicks "Send a Thnks" button on a Salesforce record
2. Thnks interface opens in an embedded iframe
3. Recipient information is automatically populated from the Salesforce record
4. User selects Thnks, adds message, and sends
5. Thnks record is created in Salesforce with full tracking

**Automated Workflow Process:**

1. Business event triggers a Salesforce Flow (e.g., demo scheduled, deal closed)
2. Flow creates a Thnks Request record with recipient and Thnks details
3. If auto-approval is enabled, Thnks is sent immediately
4. If manual approval is required, request goes to approval queue
5. Once approved, Thnks is sent and tracked in Salesforce

### Tracking Thnks Activity

When a Thnks is sent from any source (Salesforce, web app, mobile app, Chrome extension, etc.), a Thnks record is created in Salesforce with:

**Automatic Associations:**

- Lead or Contact matching (never both)
- Account association (when Contact is matched)
- Opportunity association (when Contact has open Opportunity via Contact Role)
- Task creation for activity timeline visibility

**Real-time Status Updates:**

- Status field updates as Thnks progresses (Delivered, Opened, Redeemed, etc.)
- Timestamp fields capture exact date/time of each status change
- ROI field data synchronization for custom analytics

**Comprehensive Data Capture:**

- Sender information and pricing details
- Transaction ID and direct link to Thnks
- Custom ROI fields configured in your Thnks account
- Integration with Salesforce reporting and dashboards
