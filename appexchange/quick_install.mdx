## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

## 5-Step Quick Install

### Step 1: Configure Thnks Platform Connection

Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:support@thnks.com) to:

- Enable Salesforce integration on your Thnks account
- Choose your connection method:
  - **User Connection**: Each user enables their own Thnks ↔ Salesforce connection

### Step 2: Install the Salesforce App

1. Navigate to the [Thnks AppExchange listing](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FN7gUUAT)

3. Choose installation option:

   - **Install for Specific Profiles** (configure access levels)

</Warning>

1. Contact your Thnks Account Manager or [integrations@thnks.com](mailto:support@thnks.com) to get your Organization Token
2. In Salesforce, go to **App Launcher** → search "Thnks" → **"Manage Thnks Settings"**

5. Configure additional settings:
   - **Thnks API Endpoint**: `https://api.thnks.com/` (default)
   - **Thnks Sending Interface URL**: `https://app.thnks.com/#/auto-login` (default)
   - **Enable 'Send Thnks' Feature**: Check this box
   - **Default New Requests to Auto-Approve**: Check if you want automatic approval (Only applies to Thnks Requests send via Flow automation, not Thnks sent via iframe)

### Step 4: Add Send Thnks Component to Lightning Pages

To enable the "Send a Thnks" button on record pages:

1. Navigate to **Setup** → **Object Manager**
2. Select **Contact**, **Account**, or **Opportunity**
3. Go to **Lightning Record Pages**
4. Edit the relevant page layout
5. In Lightning App Builder:
   - Drag the **"Send Thnks"** component to your desired location
   - Configure component settings as needed
   - **Save** and **Activate** the page

Repeat for all object types where you want the Send Thnks functionality.

### Step 5: Add Thnks Related Lists (Optional)

For better visibility of Thnks activity:

1. **Setup** → **Object Manager** → Select object (Contact, Account, Lead, Opportunity)
2. **Page Layouts** → Select the relevant layout
3. **Related Lists** section → Drag **"Thnks"** into the layout
