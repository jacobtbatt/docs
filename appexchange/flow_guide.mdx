## Overview

**New in v1.8**, Thnks Request flows enable you to automatically trigger Thnks based on business events in Salesforce. This powerful feature allows you to create sophisticated automation for marketing campaigns, sales cadences, and customer success workflows.

## Flow Architecture

The Thnks Request flow follows a specific pattern to ensure proper recipient selection and Thnks delivery:

### Flow Components

1. **Cadence Autolaunched Flow Start** - Triggers the flow based on your criteria
2. **Get Task Information** - Retrieves context about the triggering event
3. **Get Scheduled Recipient Info** - Identifies the recipient for the Thnks
4. **Create Scheduled Thnks Request** - Creates the Thnks Request record
5. **Create Recipients** - Sets up recipient details for processing

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create the Flow

1. Navigate to **Setup** → **Process Automation** → **Flows**
2. Click **New Flow**
3. Select **Autolaunched Flow (No Trigger)**
4. Choose your preferred flow type based on your trigger requirements

### Step 2: Configure the Trigger (Get Task Information)

## Common Flow Triggers

### Marketing Automation Examples

**Survey Completion**

```
Trigger: Record Created on Survey Response
Condition: Survey Type = "Customer Satisfaction"
Action: Send thank you Thnks
```

**Event Registration**

```
Trigger: Contact field updated
Condition: Event Status = "Registered"
Action: Send welcome Thnks
```

**Email Engagement**

```
Trigger: Marketing Cloud Journey
Condition: Email Opened + Link Clicked
Action: Send engagement Thnks
```

### Sales Cadence Examples

Condition: Subject contains "Demo" AND Type = "Meeting"
Action: Send anticipation Thnks
```

**Deal Closed Won**

```
Trigger: Opportunity Updated
Condition: Stage = "Closed Won"
Action: Send celebration Thnks
```

**Contract Signed**

```

## Auto-Approval vs Manual Approval

### Auto-Approval Configuration

For automated sending without manual intervention:

1. In **Manage Thnks Settings** → **Send Thnks** tab
2. Check **"Default New Requests to Auto-Approve"**
3. All new Thnks Requests will be processed immediately

**Best for**:

- Marketing automation
- Standard Thnks amounts
- High-volume campaigns
- System acknowledgments

### Manual Approval Configuration

For review before sending:

1. Uncheck **"Default New Requests to Auto-Approve"**
2. Set up Salesforce Approval Processes if needed
3. Requests go to approval queue for review

**Best for**:

- Sales cadences requiring personalization
- High-value Thnks
- Executive outreach
- Custom message requirements

## Testing Your Flow

### Test Setup

1. **Create Test Records**: Set up test Contacts and triggering records
2. **Run Flow**: Manually trigger your flow with test data
3. **Verify Creation**: Check that Thnks Request and Recipient records are created
4. **Check Processing**: Confirm requests are processed based on your approval settings
5. **Validate Sending**: Verify Thnks records are created after processing

### Debugging Tips

**Common Issues**:

- **No recipients found**: Check your Contact filter conditions
- **Missing field mappings**: Ensure all required fields are populated
- **Auto-approval not working**: Verify organization settings
- **Thnks ID errors**: Confirm Thnks ID exists in your Thnks catalog

**Debug Steps**:

1. Use Flow Builder's debug feature
2. Check Flow Interview details for errors
3. Review Thnks Request records for status updates
4. Verify recipient email addresses are valid

## Best Practices

### Flow Design

- Use clear, descriptive names for flow elements
- Add descriptions to complex filter conditions
- Test thoroughly before activating
- Monitor flow performance and error rates

### Data Management

- Ensure Contact data quality (valid emails)
- Use consistent Thnks IDs across flows
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider volume limits for high-frequency triggers

### Approval Strategy

- Use auto-approval for standardized campaigns
- Require manual approval for personalized outreach
- Set up proper approval routing
- Train approvers on the process

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Thnks Selection

Instead of hardcoding Thnks IDs, you can create dynamic Thnks selection:

```
Decision Element: Check Opportunity Amount
If Amount > $100,000: Thnks ID = "Premium Thnks"
If Amount > $50,000: Thnks ID = "Standard Thnks"
Else: Thnks ID = "Basic Thnks"
```

### Multiple Recipients

For sending to multiple contacts:

1. Use Loop element to iterate through Contact collection
2. Create separate Thnks Request for each recipient
3. Use consistent messaging across all requests

### Integration with Other Systems

- Connect with Marketing Cloud for email triggers
- Integrate with external survey tools
- Link to customer success platforms
- Sync with calendar systems for event triggers
