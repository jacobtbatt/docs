## System Requirements

Below please find more information on the necessary requirements before installing our Salesforce App in your instance of Salesforce.

### Supported Salesforce Editions

- **Professional**
- **Enterprise**
- **Unlimited**
- **Developer**

## Installation

In this section, we’ll walk through installing the AppExchange application in your Salesforce instance. These instructions are meant to be a high-level overview, please contact your Salesforce Administrator to discuss the process for installation onto your specific instance and to determine whether or not a Sandbox should be used first.

### Preparing Your Thnks Account for Salesforce

Contact your Thnks Account Manager (or support@thnks.com) to enable the Salesforce App connection in your organization’s Thnks account.

Thnks offers two ways to connect your users’ Thnks activity to Salesforce:

* **User Connection** - each user must enable their own Thnks \<> Salesforce connection via their Thnks account profile.

  * Note: if a user does not enable their connection, their Thnks activity will not appear in Salesforce.

* **Org Connection** - an SF admin can enable a single connection between Thnks and Salesforce. Individual users will not have to perform their own connections.

  * Note: For Thnks activity to appear in Salesforce, the email address of the Thnks user must match the email address of their Salesforce account.

### Installing from the AppExchange

To install Thnks, you’ll need to navigate to the Thnks App listing in the Salesforce AppExchange. [Here](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FN7gUUAT\&preview=%222021-02-10T20%3A06%3A08.000Z%22) is a direct link. Click on **“Get It Now”**, make sure you’re logged into the correct account, and a dialog box will appear:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose The Instance">
    Select the correct Salesforce instance, and decide whether you want to install in Production or in Sandbox, and proceed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Details">
    After confirming details and agreeing to the terms and conditions, click “Confirm and Install” to continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Determine Install Preferences">
    Lastly, determine which users you’d like to initially install the application for.
    We recommend installing for specific profiles or for admins only and reconfiguring as needed.

    <Frame>
      ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/profile_specific.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

If selecting **“Install for Specific Profiles”**, you will be able to choose one of three options for each individual profile:

* No Access (Users with this profile will not be able to see any Thnks data)

* Thnks Standard User (Users with this profile will be able to view all Thnks data, but will not be able to configure the Thnks settings)

* Thnks Admin (Users with this profile will be able to view and edit all Thnks data, as well as configure the Thnks settings)

<Frame>
  ![Access Levels](/thnks_sf_doc_images/access_levels.png)
</Frame>

At this point, you should receive an email from Salesforce confirming successful installation and should be redirected to this page with all of your installed packages. You’ve successfully installed the Thnks Salesforce App!

### Upgrading from v1.1 to v1.3 of the AppExchange Listing

If you have an old version of the Thnks AppExchange app installed in your instant of Salesforce, please follow the same instructions for install as if you were installing for the first time as seen above using [this link](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FN7gUUAT\&preview=%222021-02-10T20%3A06%3A08.000Z%22).

The main considerations to keep in mind when upgrading:

* The Thnks Status Log object will no longer be syncing records (but the old records will remain)

* There will be many new fields on the Thnks object, such as Opportunity and Account lookups, as well as several new date/time fields to replace the need of the Thnks Status Log

* There is now a tab called “Manage Thnks Settings” to configure various settings in the integration (see “Thnks Configuration” section below)

#### Backfilling Thnks Records in 1.3

If you have upgraded from 1.1 to 1.3, you will now notice that the Thnks Status Log object is no longer being used. Instead, there are new date/time fields to track the status of key events such as “Delivered Date/Time”, “Redeemed Date/Time”, etc.

In order to backfill your historical Thnks records from 1.1 with the correct dates for these new fields, you’ll need to have a user with the Thnks admin permissions in Salesforce head to the “Manage Thnks Settings” and click “Enrich Old Thnks”.

<Frame>
  ![Enrich Thnks Data](/thnks_sf_doc_images/enrich_thnks.png)
</Frame>

This will automatically scan all Thnks Status Log records, take the date/time for each key event, and then backfill the fields in this section on the Thnks object.

### Permissions

#### Install

<Frame>
  ![Conact Record](/thnks_sf_doc_images/permission_set.png)
</Frame>

#### Manually Updating Permissions

If after installing the Thnks app following the install instructions above you need to change permissions, the recommended path is by assigning Permission Sets to the appropriate Users. Alternatively, you may also grant permissions to the Thnks objects at the Profile level.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Setup" />

  <Step title="Click Into Profiles Under the User Section">
    <Frame>
      ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/profiles_settings.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Profile You Wish to Change" />

  <Step title="Click Edit at the Top of the Page">
    <Frame>
      ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/standard_user.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scroll Down to “Custom Object Permissions” and Look for “Thnks”">
    <Frame>
      ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/custom_object.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the Various Access You Wish for This Profile to Have (Read, Create, Edit, Delete, View All, Modify All)">
    <Frame>
      ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/profile_access.png)
    </Frame>

    You can ignore Thnks Status Logs, as this is no longer used in the integration

    View All would be the recommended access for the majority of end users
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Permission Sets

Alternatively, you can assign a Permission Set to individual users. From Setup, click into Users, and then choose any User which you wish to grant additional permissions to. Under “Permission Set Assignments”, click “Edit Assignments”.

<Frame>
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/assignments.png)
</Frame>

There are two Permission Sets to choose from:

* Thnks Admin (grants View/Modify All access to the Thnks object, as well as allowing this User to configure the Thnks settings)

* Thnks Standard User (grants View All access to the Thnks object)

<Frame>
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/user_permissions.png)
</Frame>

## Thnks Configuration

Once you have Thnks installed in your Salesforce environment, you will want to review the integration settings. If you click the App Launcher in Salesforce (this is the 9 dots in the top left), and then type in “Thnks”, the item “Manage Thnks Settings” should appear. Click into that.

<Frame>
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/9_dots.png)
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/thnks_typing.png)
</Frame>

There are 5 tabs:

* Contact Settings

* Lead Settings

* Opportunity Settings

* Fields Mapping

* Others

<Frame>
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/thnks_tabs.png)
</Frame>

Each tab comes pre-configured with default settings. If you wish to change these settings, there is an “Edit” button in the top right corner.

### Contact Settings

This tab is where you can customize the logic that Salesforce will use for matching Thnks records with existing Contacts in your Salesforce instance. Since Thnks are sent either using email or SMS, this means that there will be two different fields to match against: an email address or a phone number. By default, the email field being used is the standard Email field (API name of “Email”), and the phone field being used is the standard Phone field (API name of “Phone”).

However, you can change these so that Thnks matches Contacts based on any other field that is of type Email or Phone, respectively.

<Frame>
  ![Specific Profiles](/thnks_sf_doc_images/contact_settings.png)
  ![Phone Matching](/thnks_sf_doc_images/contact_phone_match.png)
</Frame>

On the right side, you will see the fields “Contacts Order By” and “Order Direction”. This is solely used for the purpose of determining which Contact to choose if you have duplicate Contacts. The definition of a duplicate is determined in this context by your Salesforce instance having more than one Contact that has the same value for the Email or Phone field you are using for matching.

As an example, if you send a Thnks to someone with the email [johndoe@gmail.com](mailto:johndoe@gmail.com), you are matching using the standard Email field, and there are two Contacts with the exact email of [johndoe@gmail.com](mailto:johndoe@gmail.com), Salesforce will identify that there are two potential matches.

The Contacts Order By field allows you to control what field you wish to use to determine which Contact to use, and the Order Direction controls the logic.

Example: if you want to choose the oldest Contact based on Created Date, you would select “Created Date” as the “Contacts Order By” field, and “ASC” for ascending in the “Order Direction”.

<Frame>
  ![Created Date](/thnks_sf_doc_images/contact_created_date.png)
</Frame>

However, if you wanted to choose the Contact with the most recent activity, you would select “Last Activity” and “DESC”.

<Frame>
  ![Last Activity](/thnks_sf_doc_images/last_activity_contact.png)
</Frame>

### Lead Settings

The concept of configuring the Lead matching is exactly the same as the Contact. Please see the above section on Contact Settings, and you can customize different logic for the Lead. Again, you can only use Email and Phone type fields for the matching logic.

The matching logic you use for the Contact has no impact on the matching logic for the Lead, and vice versa.

### Opportunity Settings

The Opportunity matching is even more simple. There are two things you can configure:

1. Whether or not you wish to match Opportunities

2. Similar to Leads and Contacts, how to decide which Opportunity you wish to match in the scenario that there is more than one matched Opportunity

Opportunities can only be matched if the following criteria are met:

1. A Contact is matched to the Thnks record

2. That Contact is associated with

3. The Opportunity is open

### Fields Mapping

The Fields Mapping tab enables you to map custom properties from within the Thnks app onto the Thnks object in Salesforce. These are custom, required fields that you can prompt users to enter when sending a Thnks. The below is just an example, as these field names will be unique to your Thnks account.

<Frame>
  ![Field Mapping](/thnks_sf_doc_images/fields_mapping.png)
</Frame>

If you create any fields on the Thnks side, you will also need to manually create the field in Salesforce with the appropriate field type (most likely these will be text or picklist).

Contact your Thnks Account Manager to coordinate the addition of Thnks Required Fields.

### Others

<Frame>
  ![Other Settings](/thnks_sf_doc_images/config_others.png)
</Frame>

The last tab is for miscellaneous settings, which for now consists of two primary features:

* How to handle Thnks when no Lead or Contact match is found

* Syncing Thnks as Activities (Tasks)

In the scenario where a Thnks is sent and the phone number or email address used is unable to find a corresponding match with a Salesforce Lead or Contact, then you have one of two options:

* Create Thnks (with no matching Lead or Contact)

* Do not create a Thnks

<Frame>
  ![Create Thnks](/thnks_sf_doc_images/create_thnks.png)
</Frame>

The other three fields in this section deal with the creation of Task records:

* First, the Task Syncing field is a simple toggle of whether or not Tasks should be created. If this is checked, a Task will be created and it will be associated with both the Thnks record and a Contact. If the Thnks is associated with a Lead, then only the Thnks record will be associated (Tasks cannot be associated with a Lead and another object). More on the Task fields being set below.
