Thnks enables customers to automate the sending of gestures of gratitude through a simple POST request to its webhook endpoint. This functionality allows seamless integration with marketing campaigns, survey completions, or other automated workflows, providing a straightforward way to enhance customer and partner relationships with genuine acts of appreciation.

## What is a Webhook?

A webhook is a mechanism that allows one application to send real-time data to another. This is achieved via an HTTP POST request containing a JSON payload sent to a specified URL. In the case of Thnks, the webhook is used to trigger the sending of a Thnks, making the process efficient and automated.

### Finding `gift_id`

To find the `gift_id` for a specific Thnks item:

1. Log into the [Thnks application](https://app.thnks.com).

2. Locate the Thnks item you want to send.

3. Navigate to the Thnks Details page. The URL will include the `gift_id`.
   Example: [https://app.thnks.com/#/send-thnks/thnks/5659](https://app.thnks.com/#/send-thnks/thnks/5659)
   Here, `5659` is the `gift_id`.
