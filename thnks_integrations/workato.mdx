# Configuring Workato to Automatically Send a Thnks  

This guide walks you through automatically triggering the sending of a Thnks using Workato recipes.

## Prerequisites  

* Access to the Thnks API.  
* Thnks API Key (Authorization Token).  
* URL for Thnks API endpoint.  
* Administrative access to your Workato workspace.  

## Setup  

<Steps>  
  <Step title="Prepare HTTP Request Data">  
    Before configuring your Workato recipe, ensure you have the following details:  

    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Thnks API URL">  
        `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="HTTP Method">  
        `POST`  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Data (JSON format)">  
        Here’s an example of the JSON payload you will need to include in the HTTP action. Replace the placeholders with dynamic data from Workato variables:  

        ```json  
        {  
          "gift_id": <GIFT_ID>,  
          "recipients": [  
            {  
              "email": "{{email}}",  
              "first_name": "{{first_name}}",  
              "last_name": "{{last_name}}",  
              "message": "Thank you for your time and support!",  
              "gift_redeem_type": "email"  
            }  
          ]  
        }  
        ```  

        * Replace `<GIFT_ID>` with the Thnks ID of the gift you want to send.  
        * Use Workato variables (e.g., `{{email}}`, `{{first_name}}`) to populate recipient data dynamically.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Headers">  
        You will need to add the following headers in the HTTP action:  

        * **Content-Type**: `application/json`  
        * **Authorization**: Your Thnks API key (Authorization Token).  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Create a Recipe in Workato">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Log into Workato and Create a New Recipe">  
        Open your Workato workspace and click **+ Create recipe** to start a new recipe.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Define the Trigger">  
        Choose a trigger based on the source system or event, such as:  
        * **New Event**: Trigger when a new event occurs in a connected app like Salesforce, HubSpot, or a webhook.  
        * **Scheduled Trigger**: Run the recipe at a specified interval.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Add an HTTP Action">  
        * Add an **Action step** and select **HTTP**.  
        * Configure the HTTP action as follows:  
          * **Method**: `POST`  
          * **Endpoint URL**: `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`  
          * **Headers**:  
            * **Content-Type**: `application/json`  
            * **Authorization**: Enter your Thnks API Key.  
          * **Request Body**: Copy the JSON payload mentioned above and replace placeholders with Workato variables.  
        * Save the action.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Add Conditional Logic or Additional Steps (Optional)">  
        Use additional actions or conditions to customize the workflow, such as:  
        * **Conditional Logic**: Add an **If/Else** condition to determine when the Thnks gift should be sent.  
        * **Data Transformations**: Use the **Data Mapping** feature to format or manipulate variables.  
        * **Error Handling**: Add steps to retry or log errors in case of API call failure.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Test and Activate the Recipe">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Run the Recipe in Test Mode">  
        Use Workato’s test mode to simulate the recipe execution and ensure the HTTP action sends data correctly to the Thnks API.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Check Execution Logs">  
        Verify the response from the Thnks API in the **Job History** or execution logs to ensure the gift was sent successfully.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Activate the Recipe">  
        Once verified, activate the recipe to enable automated Thnks sending.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Best Practices">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Error Handling">  
        Include error-handling steps to retry failed API calls or log issues for manual review.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Security">  
        Use Workato’s **Lookup Table** or **Encrypted Fields** to securely store your API Key and other sensitive data.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Testing">  
        Test the recipe with various scenarios to ensure all dynamic variables, triggers, and conditions work as intended.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  
</Steps>  

Following this process, you can automatically trigger a Thnks gift to be sent as part of a Workato recipe using the HTTP action.
