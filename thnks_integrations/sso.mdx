Thnks is committed to providing a seamless and secure experience for our enterprise clients. To achieve this, we leverage Auth0, a robust and versatile authentication solution, to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) connections to the Thnks platform. This instruction sheet will guide you through the process of configuring connections using OpenID Connect (OIDC), Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML2.0), or Azure Active Directory, depending on your organization's preference and requirements.

## OIDC
