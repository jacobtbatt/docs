# Configuring Microsoft Power Automate to Automatically Send a Thnks

This guide walks you through automatically triggering the sending of a Thnks using Power Automate flows.

## Prerequisites

* Access to the Thnks API.

* Thnks API Key (Authorization Token).

* URL for Thnks API endpoint.

* Administrative access to your Microsoft Power Automate environment.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare HTTP Request Data">
    Before configuring your Power Automate flow, ensure you have the following details:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Thnks API URL">
        `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`
      </Step>

      <Step title="HTTP Method">
        `POST`
      </Step>

      <Step title="Data (JSON format)">
        Here’s an example of the JSON payload you will need to include in the HTTP action. Replace the placeholders with dynamic data from Power Automate tokens:

        ```json
        {  
          "gift_id": <GIFT_ID>,  
          "recipients": [  
            {  
              "email": "@{triggerOutputs()?['body/email']}",  
              "first_name": "@{triggerOutputs()?['body/firstName']}",  
              "last_name": "@{triggerOutputs()?['body/lastName']}",  
              "message": "Thank you for your time and support!",  
              "gift_redeem_type": "email"  
            }  
          ]  
        }  
        ```

        * Replace `<GIFT_ID>` with the Thnks ID of the gift you want to send.

        * Use Power Automate expressions (e.g., `@{triggerOutputs()?['body/email']}`) to dynamically populate recipient data.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Headers">
        You will need to add the following headers in the HTTP action:

        * **Content-Type**: `application/json`

        * **Authorization**: Your Thnks API key (Authorization Token).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Flow in Power Automate">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Log into Power Automate and Create a New Flow">
        Open Power Automate and click **+ Create** to start building a new flow.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Choose a Trigger">
        Select a trigger to define the event that starts your flow. Examples include:

        * **When a record is updated**: Trigger the flow when a record is updated in a connected app like Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, or SharePoint.

        * **When an HTTP request is received**: Trigger the flow via an incoming webhook.

        * **Scheduled Flow**: Run the flow on a predefined schedule.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add an HTTP Action">
        * Click **+ New step** and search for **HTTP** to add an HTTP action.

        * Configure the HTTP action as follows:

          * **Method**: `POST`

          * **URI**: `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`

          * **Headers**:

            * **Content-Type**: `application/json`

            * **Authorization**: Paste your Thnks API Key.

          * **Body**: Copy the JSON payload mentioned above and replace placeholders with Power Automate expressions.

        * Save the HTTP action.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Additional Actions or Conditions (Optional)">
        Use additional actions or conditions to enhance the flow, such as:

        * **Condition**: Add a condition to determine when the HTTP action should be executed.

        * **Data Operations**: Use the Compose or Parse JSON actions to transform or manipulate data before sending it.

        * **Error Handling**: Add a parallel branch to handle errors or log failed requests.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Activate the Flow">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run the Flow Manually or with Test Data">
        Use Power Automate’s test feature to trigger the flow with sample data and ensure the HTTP action sends data correctly to the Thnks API.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Check Run History">
        Review the flow’s **Run History** to verify the API call was successful and the Thnks gift was sent.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Activate the Flow">
        Once verified, turn on the flow to enable automated Thnks sending.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Best Practices">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Error Handling">
        Add error-handling logic to retry failed API calls or log issues for manual review.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Security">
        Use Power Automate’s **Environment Variables** or **Key Vault** connectors to securely store your API Key and other sensitive data.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Testing">
        Test the flow thoroughly with various scenarios to ensure all triggers, actions, and conditions work as intended.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Following this process, you can automatically trigger a Thnks gift to be sent as part of a Power Automate flow using the HTTP action.
