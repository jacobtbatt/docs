# Configuring a Webhook in Marketo to Automatically Send a Thnks

This guide walks you through the steps to configure a webhook in Marketo that will automatically trigger the sending of a Thnks as part of a Marketo Smart Campaign.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the Thnks API.
- Thnks API Key (Authorization Token).
- URL for Thnks API endpoint.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Webhook Data">
    Before setting up the webhook, ensure you have the following details:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Thnks API URL">
        `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`
      </Step>
      <Step title="HTTP Method">
        `POST`
      </Step>
      <Step title="Data (JSON format)">
        Here’s an example of the JSON payload you will need to include in the request. You’ll need to replace the placeholders with the appropriate tokens from your Marketo leads:
        
        ```json
        {
          "gift_id": "<GIFT_ID>",
          "recipients": [
            {
              "email": "{{lead.Email Address}}",
              "first_name": "{{lead.First Name}}",
              "last_name": "{{lead.Last Name}}",
              "message": "Thank you for your time and support!",
              "gift_redeem_type": "email"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        - Replace `<GIFT_ID>` with the Thnks ID of the gift you want to send.
        - Use Marketo tokens (e.g., `{{lead.Email Address}}`) to populate dynamic lead information.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Headers">
        You will need to add the following headers in the webhook:
        - **Content-Type**: `application/json`
        - **Authorization**: Your Thnks API key (Authorization Token).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Webhook in Marketo">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Log into Marketo and go to the Admin section"/>
      <Step title="Under Integrations, click Webhooks"/>
      <Step title="Click New Webhook to create a new webhook">
        - **Webhook Name**: Give your webhook a meaningful name, e.g., `Thnks_Welcome_Program_CA`.  
        - **URL**: Use the Thnks API URL:  
          `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`
        - **Request Type**: Set this to `POST`.
        - **Template**: Copy the JSON template mentioned above and adjust as needed with the correct tokens for dynamic data population.
        - **Request Token Encoding**: None.
        - **Response Type**: Set to `JSON`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Custom Headers">
        - **Content-Type**: `application/json`  
        - **Authorization**: Paste your Thnks API Key.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Webhook Response (Optional)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Response Mappings">
        If you want to capture response data, you can map response attributes to Marketo fields. For example, you can capture a response code or success status.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Webhook to Smart Campaign">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create or Edit a Smart Campaign in Marketo"/>
      <Step title="In the Flow tab of the campaign, add the Call Webhook action"/>
      <Step title="Select the webhook you just created (e.g., Thnks_Welcome_Program_CA)"/>
      <Step title="Adjust other flow actions and campaign settings as needed"/>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Verify">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run a test by triggering the Smart Campaign with a test lead"/>
      <Step title="Check the response from Thnks in the webhook log"/>
      <Step title="Make any necessary adjustments to the payload or tokens based on the test results"/>
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Best Practices">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Error Handling">
        Include error handling in your campaign to manage cases where the webhook might fail.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Security">
        Ensure your webhook is set up securely and tokens are protected.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing">
        Run multiple tests with different scenarios to ensure all lead tokens and variables are working correctly.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Following this process, you can automatically trigger a Thnks gift to be sent as part of a Marketo Smart Campaign using webhooks.
