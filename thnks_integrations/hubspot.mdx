# Configuring a Workflow in HubSpot to Automatically Send a Thnks  

This guide walks you through automatically triggering the sending of a Thnks as part of a HubSpot workflow.

## Prerequisites  

* Access to the Thnks API.  
* Thnks API Key (Authorization Token).  
* URL for Thnks API endpoint.
* Hubspot Operations Hub Professional, Enterprise License 

## Setup  

<Steps>  
  <Step title="Prepare Webhook Data">  
    Before setting up the webhook, ensure you have the following details:  

    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Thnks API URL">  
        `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="HTTP Method">  
        `POST`  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Data (JSON format)">  
        Here’s an example of the JSON payload you will need to include in the request. You’ll need to replace the placeholders with the appropriate HubSpot contact tokens:  

        ```json  
        {  
          "gift_id": <GIFT_ID>,  
          "recipients": [  
            {  
              "email": "{{contact.email}}",  
              "first_name": "{{contact.firstname}}",  
              "last_name": "{{contact.lastname}}",  
              "message": "Thank you for your time and support!",  
              "gift_redeem_type": "email"  
            }  
          ]  
        }  
        ```  

        * Replace `<GIFT_ID>` with the Thnks ID of the gift you want to send.  
        * Use HubSpot tokens (e.g., `{{contact.email}}`) to populate dynamic contact information.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Headers">  
        You will need to add the following headers in the webhook:  

        * **Content-Type**: `application/json`  
        * **Authorization**: Your Thnks API key (Authorization Token).  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Create a Workflow in HubSpot">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Log into HubSpot and navigate to Workflows">  
        Go to the HubSpot Workflows tool in your account.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Create a New Workflow or Edit an Existing One">  
        * Choose whether to create a new workflow or edit an existing one.  
        * Define the workflow trigger criteria, such as `Contact enrollment` or any custom property change.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Add the Webhook Action">  
        * In the workflow editor, click **+** to add an action.  
        * Select **Trigger a Webhook**.  
        * Configure the webhook as follows:  
          * **Webhook URL**: `https://api.thnks.com/api/v1/gift_requests`  
          * **Method**: `POST`  
          * **Request Body**: Add the JSON template mentioned above, adjusting it with HubSpot tokens.  
          * **Headers**:  
            * **Content-Type**: `application/json`  
            * **Authorization**: Paste your Thnks API Key.  
        * Save the webhook configuration.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Test and Activate the Workflow">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Run a Test">  
        Test the workflow using a test contact to ensure the webhook triggers correctly.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Check Response Logs">  
        Verify the response from Thnks in the webhook execution logs within HubSpot.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Activate the Workflow">  
        Once verified, activate the workflow for live use.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  

  <Step title="Best Practices">  
    <Steps>  
      <Step title="Error Handling">  
        Include error handling in your workflow to manage cases where the webhook might fail, such as retry mechanisms.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Security">  
        Ensure your API Key is securely stored and not exposed in public or shared workflows.  
      </Step>  

      <Step title="Testing">  
        Test the workflow extensively with different contact scenarios to ensure all tokens and data mapping work as expected.  
      </Step>  
    </Steps>  
  </Step>  
</Steps>  

Following this process, you can automatically trigger a Thnks gift to be sent as part of a HubSpot workflow using webhooks.
